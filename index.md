I fucking hate dolphins so much. They are fucking demons. They will rape and kill for sport without a second thought. "Oh I found a baby seals let me torture it to death then no eat it." Like wtf??? They are also drug addicts, some species of dolphin are immune to puffer fish venom and get high of it by intentionally getting stung over and over usually by hitting the fish with there nose hard eventually resulting in the pufferfish's death. They will use fish as Fleshlights and rape humans, resulting in the human needing to go to the hospital or dead. Granted a human being raped by a dolphin is rare but that dosn't excuse the fact that it happens. I hate seeing people treat them like fucking saints and wonderful creatures. That's like having a crush on a serial killer. Then sharks are made out to be fucking evil even though they kill less humans than vending machines. There are even species of sharks that act like dogs for example the lemon shark. The only sharks that really try to kill humans are bull sharks and tiger sharks. Dolphins are like if humans were aquatic and had no morals.
